In Christianity, particularly in evangelical circles (including Protestantism), the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible are considered absolute.

The Bible is claimed to convey universal and eternal truths. However, there are many obvious contradictions between the ethical standards and values of modern society and the descriptions found in the Bible. To address these contradictions, convenient interpretations are often applied. Particularly, teachings on slavery and the treatment of women are frequently explained by introducing interpretations based on historical context. For example, it is often argued that " the Bible condones slavery, but this was based on the social structure of ancient times and should not be judged by modern ethical standards."

However, when it comes to doctrines such as the consistency of God's will or the gospel of salvation, no such historical context is applied. This approach appears highly convenient and raises doubts about the consistency of faith. How, then, can Christianity logically resolve these issues?

### The Incomprehensibility of God's Will

Christian apologists often invoke the "incomprehensibility of God's will" in response to contradictions and inconsistencies in the Bible. That is, God's will cannot be fully understood by humans, and the contradictions we perceive are merely part of God's larger plan. This argument seems very powerful at first glance. If God is omniscient and omnipotent, it is difficult to deny the logic that our limited understanding cannot grasp His intentions or plan.

However, this puts the concept of "free will," which is central to Christian faith, at risk. If God's will is unknowable, or if we depend on the "incomprehensibility" of God leading us to the best path, what meaning does human free will hold? Without respect for free will, acts of faith and moral choices may lose their significance. The same applies to the "guidance of the Holy Spirit" in Protestantism. If God is guiding everything behind the scenes, then the value of human effort, ethical judgment, and even biblical study itself may be diminished.

Such thinking could ultimately weaken Christianity. By relying on the incomprehensibility of God's will, believers may dilute their ethical responsibility and the practice of their faith, potentially losing sight of the core of their beliefs. If Christian doctrine depends on an "unknowable divine will," it leads to the fundamental question: why have faith at all?

### Solution

Looking toward the future of Christianity, liberal theology (Liberal Protestantism) offers the most realistic and sustainable solution in modern times. In the Middle Ages, education and research were limited, and it was common to take the Bible literally. Moreover, the abuse of power by the Catholic Church created fertile ground for the rise of evangelicalism. However, in the modern era, with advances in science and ethics, we now have the intellectual freedom to reevaluate religious beliefs.

To resolve the inconsistencies in the Bible, we need an approach that interprets the Bible as allegory or symbolism, seeking the universal ethics and divine intentions behind it. Rather than viewing the Bible as absolute historical or ethical truth, we should understand the concepts of God and salvation more flexibly, in a philosophical or allegorical sense. By doing so, we can recognize the contradictions and ethical issues within the Bible while maintaining religious belief and preserving our relationship with God.

Furthermore, instead of outright rejecting the "incomprehensibility of God's will," we can consider using it constructively. Rather than using the claim that "God's plan is unknowable" as an excuse, it should be employed to strengthen our responsibility to do our best based on contemporary knowledge and ethics. The important thing is not to be fixated on whether the Bible contains contradictions but to act ethically and correctly in the present.

### Conclusion

Modern Christianity requires a more flexible and open-minded approach to faith. Rather than treating the Bible as an absolute ethical standard, we should adopt a liberal interpretation that seeks the universal lessons and divine intentions behind it. Additionally, rather than using the incomprehensibility of God's will as an excuse, we should emphasize our responsibility to make moral judgments based on modern ethics and knowledge.
