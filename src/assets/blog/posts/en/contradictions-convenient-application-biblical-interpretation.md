title: The Problem of Contradictions and Convenient Applications in Biblical Interpretation

In Christianity, particularly in evangelical circles (including Protestantism), the inerrancy and infallibility of the
Bible are considered absolute.

The Bible is claimed to convey universal and eternal truths. However, there are many obvious contradictions between the
ethical standards and values of modern society and the descriptions found in the Bible. To address these contradictions,
convenient interpretations are often applied. Particularly, teachings on slavery and the treatment of women are
frequently explained by introducing interpretations based on historical context. For example, it is often argued that "
the Bible condones slavery, but this was based on the social structure of ancient times and should not be judged by
modern ethical standards."

However, when it comes to doctrines such as the consistency of God's will or the gospel of salvation, no such historical
context is applied. This approach appears highly convenient and raises doubts about the consistency of faith. How, then,
can Christianity logically resolve these issues?

### The Incomprehensibility of God's Will

Christian apologists often invoke the "incomprehensibility of God's will" in response to contradictions and
inconsistencies in the Bible. That is, God's will cannot be fully understood by humans, and the contradictions we
perceive are merely part of God's larger plan. This argument seems very powerful at first glance. If God is omniscient
and omnipotent, it is difficult to deny the logic that our limited understanding cannot grasp His intentions or plan.

However, I believe this puts the concept of "free will," which is central to Christian faith, at risk. If God's will is
unknowable, or if we depend on the "incomprehensibility" of God leading us to the best path, what meaning does human
free will hold? Without the respect for free will, acts of faith and moral choices may lose their significance. The same
applies to the "guidance of the Holy Spirit" in Protestantism. If God is guiding everything behind the scenes, then the
value of human effort, ethical judgment, and even biblical study itself may be diminished.

Such thinking could ultimately weaken Christianity. By relying on the incomprehensibility of God's will, believers may
dilute their ethical responsibility and the practice of their faith, potentially losing sight of the core of their
beliefs. If Christian doctrine depends on an "unknowable divine will," it leads to the fundamental question: why have
faith at all?

### Solution

Looking toward the future of Christianity, I believe liberal theology (Liberal Protestantism) offers the most realistic
and sustainable solution in modern times. In the Middle Ages, education and research were limited, and it was common to
take the Bible literally. Moreover, the abuse of power by the Catholic Church created fertile ground for the rise of
evangelicalism. However, in the modern era, with advances in science and ethics, we now have the intellectual freedom to
reevaluate religious beliefs.

Therefore, to resolve the inconsistencies in the Bible, we need an approach that interprets the Bible as allegory or
symbolism, seeking the universal ethics and divine intentions behind it. Rather than viewing the Bible as absolute
historical or ethical truth, we should understand the concepts of God and salvation more flexibly, in a philosophical or
allegorical sense. By doing so, we can recognize the contradictions and ethical issues within the Bible while
maintaining religious belief and preserving our relationship with God.

Furthermore, instead of outright rejecting the "incomprehensibility of God's will," we can consider using it
constructively. Rather than using the claim that "God's plan is unknowable" as an excuse, it should be employed to
strengthen our responsibility to do our best based on contemporary knowledge and ethics. The important thing is not to
be fixated on whether the Bible contains contradictions but to act ethically and correctly in the present.

### Conclusion

Modern Christianity requires a more flexible and open-minded approach to faith. Rather than treating the Bible as an
absolute ethical standard, we should adopt a liberal interpretation that seeks the universal lessons and divine
intentions behind it. Additionally, rather than using the incomprehensibility of God's will as an excuse, we should
emphasize our responsibility to make moral judgments based on modern ethics and knowledge.
